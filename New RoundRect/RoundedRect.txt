   'RoundRectangle (Symmetric) William W.
   'this roundrect function should work in windows 95 paths (WIN95=true)
   'all the way to the present pretty darn fast comparable
   'to the gdi Roundrect Function and its always symmetrical
   'since it uses one arc of the ellipse for all the corners
   'also the number of segments
   'used to draw the corner can be specified
   'otherwise they are calculated to be fast yet still good quality

   'ONE Important Difference:
   'While the GDI RoundRect is considered a filled shape
   'This Roundrect fuction does NOT fill the shape drawn
   'it only frames/outlines the shape if win95= true
   'You use Polygon instead of polyline
   'if you desire filled shapes to be drawn but you lose
   'windows 95 path compatibility (WIN95=false)

   'SEGMENTS
   'you can overide this by specifying segments when calling this function
   'otherwise its calculated
   'Note if you have too few segments it may make shapes non-symmetric
   'Remember when specifying segments its only for one corner so segments*4
   'Segments also can define quality from 0-3 above 3 segments and it defines
   the number of segments used to draw the figure
   '0=Low, 1=Med Low, 2=Med, 3= High, 4= 4 segments, 5= 5 segments, 6=......
